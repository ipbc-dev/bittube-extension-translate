The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law.

If the value of relief sought is more than €75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, BitTube will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, BitTube will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Finally, if the value of the relief sought is €75,000 or less, BitTube will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. BitTube will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. But, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than €75,000 in relief, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the DIS Rules.",
		"TermsOfServiceText76": "Confidentiality",
		"TermsOfServiceText77": "All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.",
		"TermsOfServiceText78": "Severability",
		"TermsOfServiceText79": "Without limiting the severability provision in the Section titled \"General Provisions\" of this Agreement, if a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than clause (b) of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions of clause (b) of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of this Agreement will continue to apply.",
		"TermsOfServiceText80": "Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement",
		"TermsOfServiceText81": "Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, BitTube agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending BitTube written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement.",
		"TermsOfServiceText82": "General provisions",
		"TermsOfServiceText83": "This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Germany, without regard to any choice of law, conflicts of law or other principles that would result in the applicable of the laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction.",
		"TermsOfServiceText84": "This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein are personal to you, and you may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of BitTube. BitTube may freely assign this Agreement, including, without limitation, in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization, or sale of some or all of our assets or stock.",
		"TermsOfServiceText85": "If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement are for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired and shall remain in full force and effect, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) shall be replaced by a valid, legal and enforceable provision or provisions that comes closest to the intent of the parties underlying the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s).",
		"TermsOfServiceText86": "The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.",
		"TermsOfServiceText87": "If BitTube is unable to perform any obligation under this Agreement because of any matter beyond its reasonable control, such as lightning, flood, exceptionally severe weather, fire, explosion, war, civil disorder, industrial disputes (whether or not involving employees of BitTube), acts of local or central government or other competent authorities, problems with telecommunications providers, hostile network attacks or other events beyond BitTube’s reasonable control (each, a \"Force Majeure Event\"), BitTube will have no liability to you for such failure to perform; provided, however, that BitTube shall resume performance promptly upon removal of the circumstances constituting the Force Majeure Event. If any Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) days, either BitTube or you may terminate this Agreement by delivery of written notice to the other party. You will remain responsible for all Fees incurred through the last day the Services were available. If you and BitTube have executed a separate user Agreement applicable to your access to and use of the Site, Services and/or Software, then the terms and conditions of such Subscription Agreement shall prevail to the extent of any conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In all other cases, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between BitTube and you with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between BitTube and you. No waiver or modification of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.",
