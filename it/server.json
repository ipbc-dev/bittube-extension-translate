Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and BitTube are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

For information on the DIS, please visit its website, http://www.disarb.org/em/. Information about the DIS Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the DIS’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.disarb.org/. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the DIS Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.",
     "TermsOfServiceText73":"Unless BitTube and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by DIS. If your claim is for €10,000 or less, BitTube agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the DIS Rules. If your claim exceeds €10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the DIS Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.",
     "TermsOfServiceText74":"Costs of Arbitration",
     "TermsOfServiceText75":"Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the DIS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is €75,000 or less, at your request, BitTube will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than €75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, BitTube will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, BitTube will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Finally, if the value of the relief sought is €75,000 or less, BitTube will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. BitTube will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. But, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than €75,000 in relief, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the DIS Rules.",
